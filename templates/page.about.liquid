                    <p class="about-page__testimonial-text">From the very beginning, Karen and Pamela at Florida
                        Beach Weddings
                        went to great
                        lengths to fully understand my wife's and my vision for our wedding. We wanted something
                        beautiful and memorable, yet also a stress free experience for both us and our guests. I
                        can honestly say Florida Beach Weddings delivered in every way on that vision. Not only
                        did they walk us through the entire process, allowing us to customize the wedding to our
                        desired specifications, but most importantly, every single time we called, every single
                        time we emailed, and every single time we may have seemingly bugged them along the way,
                        they were always there to promptly answer our questions, reassure us, and see to it that
                        our special day went off without a hitch. As an extra feather in their cap, they managed
                        all of this during the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. The customer service they
                        provided was some of the best I have seen out of any company, period. With all that
                        said, I cannot recommend Florida Beach Weddings highly enough. They provided exactly
                        what we were looking for and then some. To Karen and Pamela, thank you again for our
                        special day!!!</p>

                        wedding from Ohio very
                        easy. Everyone is very helpful and provided great recommendations for flowers, cake, and
                        food. I wouldnâ€™t change anything about my wedding! Thanks so much for all your hard
                        work, you made my special day over the top.</p>
